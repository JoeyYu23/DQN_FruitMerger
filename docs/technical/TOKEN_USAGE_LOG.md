### Token Efficiency Notes

- Heavy documentation generation (LaTeX files are verbose but valuable)
- Multiple file reads for understanding codebase
- Could optimize by reading fewer files if specific targets known

### Recommendations for Future Sessions

- For simple queries: Expect 1,000-5,000 tokens
- For code generation: Expect 5,000-15,000 tokens
- For comprehensive documentation: Expect 20,000-40,000 tokens
- Current pace allows for ~3-4 more similar sessions within budget
